abstract = {Particularly older people are at risk for deficient vitamin D levels, as their capability for cutaneous synthetization is lower and they are often less exposed to sunlight. However, the resulting impact on one individual's health is not fully understood. To examine potential consequences of low vitamin D levels for health of older people, we examined its relationship with a DNA related biomarker of aging, DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA). Several epigenetic clocks, that are used to estimate this parameter from methylation fractions of specific cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites, are available and differ in aspects of aging they represent best. Five clocks, 7-CpG clock, Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge, were available in the longitudinal BASE-II cohort (n=1,100) at follow-up examination. DNAmAA estimated from 7-CpG clock and GrimAge was associated with vitamin D levels in covariate adjusted regression analysis. Additionally, a quasi-interventional study design was employed and showed 2.6 year lower 7-CpG DNAmAA (p=0.011) and 1.3-year lower Horvath DNAmAA (p=0.042) in vitamin D deficient participants that chose to start vitamin D supplementation during the follow-up period of 7.4 ± 1.5 years compared to a matched control-group of participants with untreated vitamin D deficiency. No statistically significant difference was found between sufficiently treated participants with vitamin D deficiency and a matched group of participants that reached sufficient vitamin D level without supplementation. Although validation of our results in a randomized controlled trial is needed, our findings suggest, that vitamin D deficiency associated higher rates of epigenetic aging can potentially be reversed through supplementation.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS) relies on cut-off values for five cardiovascular risk factors, three of which must be met to make the diagnosis. While this approach has certain advantages in the clinical setting, it only allows a binary classification relying on cut-off values. Thus, individuals receiving the same MetS diagnosis may differ in terms of disease severity. We have recently developed a continuous measure of the metabolic load (MetL) that was calculated as a latent factor from indicators that are used to diagnose the MetS enabling a more differentiated assessment. DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA) is a widely accepted biomarker of aging which can be derived from a variety of epigenetic clocks. However, it is still unclear which aspects of aging these biomarkers represent best. Aim of the current study was to evaluate whether and how the MetS and MetL relate to DNAmAA derived from five epigenetic clocks (7-CpG clock, Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge). MetS was diagnosed according to the AHA/IDF/NHLBI criteria (2009) and the latent MetL factor was extracted from a confirmatory factor analysis considering the same diagnostic parameters. DNAmAA estimated from PhenoAge and GrimAge were significantly associated with MetS (beta=0.036 and beta=0.063, both p<0.05) and MetL (both beta=0.009 and p<0.05) in regression analyses adjusted for age and gender including 1,100 participants from the follow-up assessments of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II, mean age 75.6 ±3.8 years). The results will be discussed with respect to clinical relevance in the context of current literature.},

abstract = {The decline in episodic memory (EM) performance is a hallmark of cognitive aging and an early clinical sign in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles from buccal and blood samples for cross-sectional (n = 1019) and longitudinal changes in EM performance (n = 626; average follow-up time 5.4 years) collected under the auspices of the Lifebrain consortium project. The mean age of participants with cross-sectional data was 69 ± 11 years (30–90 years), with 50% being females. We identified 21 loci showing suggestive evidence of association (p < 1 × 10−5) with either or both EM phenotypes. Among these were SNCA, SEPW1 (both cross-sectional EM), ITPK1 (longitudinal EM), and APBA2 (both EM traits), which have been linked to AD or Parkinson's disease (PD) in previous work. While the EM phenotypes were nominally significantly (p < 0.05) associated with poly-epigenetic scores (PESs) using EWASs on general cognitive function, none remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Likewise, estimating the degree of “epigenetic age acceleration” did not reveal significant associations with either of the two tested EM phenotypes. In summary, our study highlights several interesting candidate loci in which differential DNAm patterns in peripheral tissue are associated with EM performance in humans.},

abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) assessing the link between DNA methylation (DNAm) and phenotypes related to structural brain measures, cognitive function, and neurodegenerative diseases are becoming increasingly more popular. Due to the inaccessibility of brain tissue in humans, several studies use peripheral tissues such as blood, buccal swabs, and saliva as surrogates. To aid the functional interpretation of EWAS findings in such settings, there is a need to assess the correlation of DNAm variability across tissues in the same individuals. In this study, we performed a correlation analysis between DNAm data of a total of n = 120 matched post-mortem buccal and prefrontal cortex samples. We identified nearly 25,000 (3% of approximately 730,000) cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites showing significant (false discovery rate q < 0.05) correlations between buccal and PFC samples. Correlated CpG sites showed a preponderance to being located in promoter regions and showed a significant enrichment of being determined by genetic factors, i.e. methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL), based on buccal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mQTL databases. Our novel buccal–brain DNAm correlation map will provide a valuable resource for future EWAS using buccal samples for studying DNAm effects on phenotypes relating to the brain. All correlation results are made freely available to the public online.},

abstract = {Background: Studies on DNA methylation (DNAm) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have recently highlighted several genomic loci showing association with disease onset and progression. Methods: Here, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using DNAm profiles in entorhinal cortex (EC) from 149 AD patients and control brains and combined these with two previously published EC datasets by meta-analysis (total n = 337). Results: We identified 12 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites showing epigenome-wide significant association with either case–control status or Braak's tau-staging. Four of these CpGs, located in proximity to CNFN/LIPE, TENT5A, PALD1/PRF1, and DIRAS1, represent novel findings. Integrating DNAm levels with RNA sequencing-based mRNA expression data generated in the same individuals showed significant DNAm-mRNA correlations for 6 of the 12 significant CpGs. Lastly, by calculating rates of epigenetic age acceleration using two recently proposed “epigenetic clock” estimators we found a significant association with accelerated epigenetic aging in the brains of AD patients vs. controls. Conclusion: In summary, our study represents the hitherto most comprehensive EWAS in AD using EC and highlights several novel differentially methylated loci with potential effects on gene expression.},

abstract = {Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are at risk for micro- and macrovascular complications. Implementable risk scores are needed to improve targeted prevention for patients that are particularly susceptible to complications. The epigenetic clock estimates an individual's biological age using DNA methylation profiles. In this study, we examined older adults of the Berlin Aging Study II that were reexamined on average 7.4 years after baseline assessment as part of the GendAge study. DNA methylation age (DNAmA) and its deviation from chronological age DNAmA acceleration (DNAmAA) were calculated with the 7-CpG clock (available at both timepoints, n = 1,071), Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, PhenoAge and GrimAge (available at follow-up only, n = 1,067). T2D associated complications were assessed with the Diabetes Complications Severity Index (DCSI). We report on a statistically significant association between oral glucose tolerance test results and Hannum and PhenoAge DNAmAA. PhenoAge was also associated with fasting glucose. In contrast, we found no cross-sectional association after covariate adjustment between DNAmAA and a diagnosis of T2D. However, longitudinal analyses showed that every additional year of 7-CpG DNAmAA at baseline increased the odds for developing one or more additional complications or worsening of an already existing complication during the follow-up period by 11% in male participants with T2D. This association persisted after covariate adjustment (OR = 1.11, p = 0.045, n = 56). Although our results remain to be independently validated, this study shows promising evidence of utility of the 7-CpG clock in identifying patients with diabetes who are at high risk for developing complications. Deterioration of vision, kidney function and cardiovascular function are just a few examples of diabetes-related complications. However, not all patients develop these complications, and it is desirable to detect patients that have a high risk for the complications early. In this study, we examine markers, which are based on reversible modifications of the DNA, in the context of diabetes and its complications. We found that one of these biomarkers is able to predict the development of diabetes complications over a period of about seven years in our dataset. If these results can be confirmed in other studies, our findings might help physicians to identify patients with diabetes that have an increased risk for developing complications in the future. Vetter et al. evaluate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between DNA methylation age acceleration and type 2 diabetes and its complications in older adults. Although epigenetic aging does not associate with a diagnosis of diabetes, 7-CpG-based estimates are associated with increased risk of developing complications.},

abstract = {DNA methylation age (DNAm age, epigenetic clock) is a novel and promising biomarker of aging. It is calculated from the methylation fraction of specific cytosine phosphate guanine sites (CpG sites) of genomic DNA. Several groups have proposed epigenetic clock algorithms and these differ mostly regarding the number and location of the CpG sites considered and the method used to assess the methylation status. Most epigenetic clocks are based on a large number of CpGs, e.g. as measured by DNAm microarrays. We have recently evaluated an epigenetic clock based on the methylation fraction of seven CpGs that were determined by methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE). This method is more cost-effective when compared to array-based technologies as only a few CpGs need to be examined. However, there is only little data on the correspondence in epigenetic age estimation using the 7-CpG clock and other algorithms. To bridge this gap, in this study we measured the 7-CpG DNAm age using two methods, via MS-SNuPE and via the MethylationEPIC array, in a sample of 1,058 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), assessed as part of the GendAge study. On average, participants were 75.6 years old (SD: 3.7, age range: 64.9–90.0, 52.6% female). Agreement between methods was assessed by Bland-Altman plots. DNAm age was highly correlated between methods (Pearson's r = 0.9) and Bland-Altman plots showed a difference of 3.1 years. DNAm age by the 7-CpG formula was 71.2 years (SD: 6.9 years, SNuPE) and 68.1 years (SD: 6.4 years, EPIC array). The mean of difference in methylation fraction between methods for the seven individual CpG sites was between 0.7 and 13 percent. To allow direct conversion of DNAm age obtained from both methods we developed an adjustment formula with a randomly selected training set of 529 participants using linear regression. After conversion of the Illumina data in a second and independent validation set, the adjusted DNAm age was 71.44 years (SD: 6.1 years, n = 529). In summary, we found the results of DNAm clocks to be highly comparable. Furthermore, we developed an adjustment formula that allows for direct conversion of DNAm age estimates between methods and enables one singular clock to be used in studies that employ either the Illumina or the SNuPE method.},

We analyzed data from 1,100 Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) participants assessed as part of the GendAge study (mean age = 75.6 years, SD = 3.8 years, 52.1% women). In a first step, we replicated well-established associations of perceived stress with morbidity, frailty, and symptoms of depression in the BASE-II cohort studied here. In a second step, we did not find any statistically significant association of perceived stress with any of the five epigenetic clocks in multiple linear regression analyses that adjusted for covariates. Although the body of literature suggests an association between higher DNAmAA and stress or trauma during early childhood, the current study found no evidence for an association of perception of stress with DNAmAA in older people. We discuss possible reasons for the lack of associations and highlight directions for future research.},

DNAmAA was estimated with the 7-CpG clock, Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Methylation data were obtained through methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE) or Illumina's Infinium “MethylationEPIC” array. Vitamin D–deficient participants who chose to start vitamin D supplementation after baseline examination showed a 2.6-year lower 7-CpG DNAmAA (p = 0.011) and 1.3-year lower Horvath DNAmAA (p = 0.042) compared to untreated and vitamin D–deficient participants. DNAmAA did not statistically differ between participants with successfully treated vitamin D deficiency and healthy controls (p > 0.16). Therefore, we conclude that intake of vitamin D supplement is associated with lower DNAmAA in participants with vitamin D deficiency.},

abstract = {DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA, derived from an epigenetic clock) and relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) are widely accepted biomarkers of aging. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which aspects of aging they represent best. Here we evaluated longitudinal associations between baseline rLTL and DNAmAA (estimated with 7-CpG clock) and functional assessments covering different domains of aging. Additionally, we made use of cross-sectional data on these assessments and examined their association with DNAmAA estimated by 5 different DNAm age measures. Two-wave longitudinal data were available for 1 083 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II who were reexamined on average 7.4 years after baseline as part of the GendAge study. Functional outcomes were assessed with Fried's frailty score, Tinetti mobility test, falls in the past 12 months (yes/no), finger-floor distance, Mini-Mental State Examination, Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression scale, activities of daily living, instrumented ADL, and mini nutritional assessment. Overall, we found no evidence for an association between the molecular biomarkers measured at baseline, rLTL, and DNAmAA (7-CpG clock), and functional assessments assessed at follow-up. Similarly, a cross-sectional analysis of follow-up data did also not show evidence for associations of the various DNAmAA measures (7-CpG clock, Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock PhenoAge, and GrimAge) with functional assessments. In conclusion, neither rLTL nor 7-CpG DNAmAA was able to predict impairment in the analyzed assessments over a $\sim$7-year time course. Similarly, DNAmAA estimated from 5 epigenetic clocks was not a good cross-sectional marker of health deterioration either.},
